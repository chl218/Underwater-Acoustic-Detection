# Underwater Acoustic Detection

We are working with Scripps Institute of Oceanography, to implement a signal
detection algorithm and a convoluted neural network algorithm to analysis the
trends of marine life over time. As humans, we are hugely depended on the ocean
and its ecosystems, which provides us with a food-chain block as well as large
portion of our atmosphere's oxygen. However, despite our dependences on the
ocean’s ecosystem, we have continue to negatively impact our ocean's health in
the past few decades such as overfishing, industrial pollution, and oil spills. 

So, to more accurately investigate how human actions have affected the marine
live’s ecosystems, this project was greenlit as a way to record fish acoustics
and provide the data to scientist across the globe to analysis our ocean's
health and forecast what the trends of marine lives is heading towards.
